# QUICK FIX CHECKLIST - Render Deployment

## ‚ö†Ô∏è URGENT: Manual Configuration Required

The YAML file is being ignored. Follow these steps immediately:

### ‚úÖ Step-by-Step Fix:

1. **Go to Render Dashboard**
   - [ ] Open render.com
   - [ ] Find your service: `qr-access-request-api`
   - [ ] Click on the service

2. **Update Settings**
   - [ ] Go to Settings tab
   - [ ] Find "Build & Deploy" section
   - [ ] Change Build Command to: `npm install --production`
   - [ ] Change Start Command to: `node server.js`
   - [ ] Set Root Directory to: `server`
   - [ ] Save changes

3. **Verify Environment Variables**
   - [ ] Go to Environment tab
   - [ ] Ensure NODE_ENV=production
   - [ ] Ensure PORT=10000
   - [ ] Add all other required variables

4. **Deploy**
   - [ ] Go to Deploys tab
   - [ ] Click "Deploy Latest Commit"
   - [ ] Monitor build logs

### üéØ Expected Results:
- ‚úÖ Build successful
- ‚úÖ No "nodemon not found" errors
- ‚úÖ Server starts with `node server.js`
- ‚úÖ Health check responds at `/api/health`

### üö® If Still Failing:
1. Double-check Root Directory = `server`
2. Verify all environment variables are set
3. Try manual deploy from specific commit
4. Check GitHub repository has latest code

**This manual configuration will override the YAML issues!**
